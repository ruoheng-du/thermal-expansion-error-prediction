# Thermal Expansion Error Prediction | Summer 2023
This is the repository for the thermal expansion error prediction research project done during Summer 2023. This project uses the LSTM network for training and regression. Most of the programming and tidying work were done through Python Keras & Scikit-learn & Pandas, which can be found in the lstm_keras directory. Some other MATLAB implementations can be found in the lstm_matlab directory. Please feel free to email me at rd2910@nyu.edu for any more information.

## Result - Python
The best model has a train RMSE of 0.126 and a test RMSE of 0.127. More details can be found under the /lstm_keras/best model/ directory.
